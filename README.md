## Progress

### Sprint #1

For this week, we focused on adding the skeleton to the code base from a previously done project and we plan to work off of it to get our desired project we have a lot of pages to add and a database to perfect.There was a bug with the comment code, but we fixed it and have our database and login set up. Next week, we plan to get our pages added to the project.

### Sprint #2

For this week, we focused on adding the pages and a menu to navigate across the app. So we continued working on from what we started with and made a lot of progress with the frontend portion of the application. The hard part will be the backend and getting the table views to cooperate and adding the assests. The basic structure of our project is almost built up, and all we need is to fill in the blanks. Next week, we'll continue on polishing the frontend part and begin looking into the table views and database. Along with figureing out a way of populating our database.

### Sprint #3

This week was the beginning for finals week for some of us and we were not able to get a lot of what we wanted done, but we did get a nice progress update with the progress, acount, menu, and login pages. The backend still needs some more tweaking, but once we have the table views done, we should be in the home strech.
